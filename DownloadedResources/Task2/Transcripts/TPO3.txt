Now listen to two students discussing the announcement.
(woman) Do you believe any of this? It's ridiculous.
(man) What do you mean? It is important to eat healthy foods.
(woman) Sure it is! But they are saying a yogurt is better for you than an omelet or than hot cereal? I mean, whether something is hot or cold, that shouldn't be the issue. Let's say maybe on a cold morning, in that case, which is going to be better for you, a bowl of cold cereal or a nice warm omelet? It's obvious. There's no question.
(man) I'm not gonna argue with you there.(woman) And this whole thing about saving money.
(man) What about it?
(woman) Well, they are actually going to make things worse for us, not better. Cause if they start to cutting back and we can't get what we want here on campus, well, we are going to going off campus and pay off-campus prices. And you know what? That'll be expensive. Even if it's only two or three mornings a week, it can add up.
