Now listen to two students discussing the article.
(woman) Did you see that article?
(man) Yeah, and it sounds like a great idea. It's really good for students in that program.
(woman) Don't they cook in class anyway?
(man) Well, yeah, they do. But, my cousin was in the program a few years ago, and she said that it's very different to cook for a lot of people in that kind of atmosphere than to cook for classmates.
(woman) Why is that?
(man) Well, in class you can take your time, but, cooking for more people, there's more pressure, I mean, you're in a rush, people are waiting and it might be easy to make a mistake with all that stress.(woman) Then I'll think you are a bad chef, right?
(man) Absolutely!
(woman) So, OK, it's good practice. But what about the extra cost?
(man) Well, look at it this way. You've eaten at some of the fancier restaurants in town, right?
(woman) Yeah, there are some great places to eat around here.
(man) Well, these students, they’ll be making fantastic meals and it’s gonna be cheaper than going out to one of those restaurants.
(woman) Much cheaper, actually.
(man) So, you know, it’ll be worth it. The meals will be as good as the ones in those expensive restaurants.
