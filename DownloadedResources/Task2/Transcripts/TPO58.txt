MALE STUDENT: Hey, what do you think about this idea?
FEMALE STUDENT: Well, it sounds great, but I don’t actually think it would work very well.
MALE STUDENT: Oh, really?
FEMALE STUDENT: Yeah… I mean, I get what he’s saying, but I don’t think he’s thought about the problems with that kind of thing.
MALE STUDENT: No?
FEMALE STUDENT: No… I’m worried about the books—it’d be really easy to spill something on them accidentally, and then they could get ruined… and some of them are really expensive.
MALE STUDENT: Yeah, even if people tried to be careful that would probably happen sometimes.
FEMALE STUDENT: Exactly. And the other thing is, we already have the convenience store in the student center, which sells that same kind of stuff.
MALE STUDENT: That’s true…
FEMALE STUDENT: And the student center is actually much closer to the academic buildings where classes are held… the bookstore is all the way on the other side of campus; it’s not close to the buildings where students are taking classes. So I don’t think students would really go there between classes the way he says.
