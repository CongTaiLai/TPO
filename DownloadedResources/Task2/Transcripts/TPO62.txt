Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
Male Student: Did you see Jason’s letter in the paper? What do you think?
Female Student: I think he’s wrong. I feel it is useful to students. It’s used all the time. To speak as it isn’t used for sports anymore doesn’t mean it’s useless. Plenty of people go there to relax or study and stuff, don’t you?
Male Student: Yeah, sometimes. I think students who live in the nearby dorms hang out there a lot. It’s a nice spot.
Female Student: That’s what I’m saying. And it’s great to just have an open area like that, some place you can study outside or take a nap, or whatever.
Male Student: We don’t have enough places like that on campus.
Female Student: I don’t want to see it covered over with pavement and a bunch of cars.
Male Student: Guess it would be kind of a shame.
Female Student: And I don’t believe what he says about needing it either.
Male Student: What do you mean? It’s right next to all the dorms.
Female Student: But there’s already enough parking in every dorm, and those lots are never full as it is.
Male Student: True. But some students commute and…
Female Student: Most of them would rather park in the lots that are closer to the classroom buildings. It’s at least a fifteen-minute walk from Sander’s Field.
Male Student: Yeah, it’s not that close to the main part of campus.
