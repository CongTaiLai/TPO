Now, listen to two students discussing the letter.
M: Hey, Mary. Did you see this? You think he’s right?
W: No. I don’t agree with him.
M: How come?
W: Well, because it’s not like the street out front is the only space you can park. You can also park at the dining hall, which is only a couple of blocks away or the library, which is a few blocks in the other direction. He doesn’t mention that.
M: That’s true. I guess there are other lots nearby.
W: Yeah, so there’s not really a need for it. Students may have to walk a little but that’s ok. I don’t think there always needs to be a spot right outside the building you’re going to.
M: That’s true.
W: But the other problem I have with it is even if they went ahead with his idea, it’s the location he suggests. They can’t just clear away those trees, that’s one of the only wooded areas left on campus. We don’t have many trees here and they should preserve the ones we have.
M: Yeah, it is pretty.
W: Well, yeah, and sometimes students like to sit out there in the shade on a nice day to study or read under the trees. They should leave it alone, not destroy it to make away for something we don’t need.
