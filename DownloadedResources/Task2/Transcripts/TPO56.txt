FEMALE STUDENT: Did you see Julia’s letter?
MALE STUDENT: Yeah, I did.
FEMALE STUDENT: And?
MALE STUDENT: I’m all for it.
FEMALE STUDENT: Yeah?
MALE STUDENT: Yeah, jobs like that provide students with great work experience, experience they can use in the real world.
FEMALE STUDENT: Like what?
MALE STUDENT: Well, I mean, basically, they’d be running a business. They’d learn how to do it all—make up staff schedules, keep track of inventory, order supplies, make sure the building is maintained …
FEMALE STUDENT: Yeah, I guess you could learn a lot.
MALE STUDENT: Yeah, stuff you can really use when you graduate. Especially if you’re thinking of starting your own business.
FEMALE STUDENT: OK, yeah, I can see that. But her second point doesn’t make a lot of sense to me. I mean, we have a nice cafeteria. What’s wrong with eating there?
MALE STUDENT: Well it is a nice cafeteria. But sometimes the lines are really long, and you just don’t have time to wait.
FEMALE STUDENT: Yeah, that’s true.
MALE STUDENT: Especially if all you want is like a cup of coffee, or a quick sandwich or something.
FEMALE STUDENT: That’s true. But if you have a car …
MALE STUDENT: Yeah, if you have a car—which a lot of students don’t—you can drive to one of the stores in town. But still, the closest one’s like a fifteen-minute drive, so round-trip it takes at least a half an hour.
FEMALE STUDENT: And that’s time you could use for studying.
MALE STUDENT: Exactly.
