Woman: So what do you think about letter?
Man: Well, it might sound like a good idea, but I really don’t think it’s going to have any of the benefits that the letter writer says it will.
Woman: So you don’t agree with it?
Man: No, if anything, it’s going to hurt our relationship with our town, I mean forcing students to volunteer, it’s gonna make them see it as a chore, a nuisance, and so they are not going to put their hearts into it, which is going to make the university look bad.
Woman: You are saying that students doing volunteer work in town will be unenthusiastic? And…
Man: Right, it would be obvious they don’t want to be there. That should not going to make things better, you know, in terms of how we are regarded by people in the local community.
Woman: But maybe students would learn to like it.
Man: I really doubt it. The whole idea that this is going to encourage students to do more volunteering in the future is just ridiculous. A lot of students are likely to come away from the experience with negative feelings about it.
Woman：Yeah, especially if their studies suffer from being forced to spend time away from them.
Man：All the students I know already complain about not having enough time as it is. So this extra work is going to be a bad experience, the hardly inspiration for them to pursue more volunteer work after they graduate.
