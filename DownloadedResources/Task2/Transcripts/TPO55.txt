MALE STUDENT：Did you read the announcement?
FEMALE STUDENT：Yeah, but you know... I really don’t think it’ll be that beneficial.
MALE STUDENT：How come? It seems alright... I know they need some volunteers in town to work at the youth center...
FEMALE STUDENT：Well, it’s a nice idea, but making it mandatory will probably have the opposite effect from what the announcement says. It’s a great thing for the university to encourage and all…
MALE STUDENT：Sure…
FEMALE STUDENT：…but having a requirement... that’s gonna cause resentment, not inspire students to volunteer more. We’ll probably all fulfill the requirement… then try to avoid volunteering in the future. It’ll leave a bad taste in my mouth, I’m afraid.
MALE STUDENT：Yeah, I can see that.
FEMALE STUDENT：And also, I mean... it’s great that there’s opportunities nearby. But still, most of them probably aren’t within walking distance. Like the park--they’re always looking for volunteers to clean the area. But most students—including me—don’t have cars on campus.
MALE STUDENT：Yeah… me neither.
FEMALE STUDENT：And there isn’t much public transportation either. Even if these places are local, how are we supposed to get there? It’s just not practical.
