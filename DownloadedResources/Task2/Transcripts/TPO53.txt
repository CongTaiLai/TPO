M: So what do you think of the new policy?
W: Well, they’ve got the right idea. But I don’t think it will work out as they planned.
M: Really? Why not?
W: I just feel they haven’t thought through the consequences. For example, have you seen the new lights? They’ve already been installed in the reference room, they are just not bright enough.
M: Oh.
W: Yeah. And there are sorts of individual lamps in the study areas.
M: The reading lamps?
W: Yeah, the reading lamps. Well nobody uses them, nobody turns them on now. But people are gonna start turning them all on if the overhead light is dimmer. So any saving is gonna go away.
M: OK, but what about what they are doing with the air conditioning? That’s surly going to save.
W: Save energy? You bet. But there is a different problem. Think about what the library’s going to be like on hot days?
M: It’s certainly gonna be a lot less comfortable.
W: Right now the library is the best place to get studying done. It’s pretty comfortable and it’s quiet. I think now when it is really hot, students will just wind up studying back to their dorm rooms. I know I will.
M: Cause the dorms will be still cool on hot days. But they are often so noisy.
W: Exactly, loud and busy and bad for my concentration.
M: So people won’t have any really good place to study.
