Now listen to two students discussing the newspaper article.
Male Student: You know, this makes so much sense. I wonder why it took them so long.
Female Student: Oh, I don’t think it makes sense.
Male Student: Why not?
Female Student: Well, I don’t think you need to have similar interests to make friends. Look at my roommate and me. We are completely different. I mean, she is a French major, and I’m studying bio-chemistry. She’s really into sports, and I, well, let’s just say I’m not very athletic.
Male Student: Yeah, but you guys are good friends.
Female Student: Exactly, that’s my point. We get along great.
Male Student: I see. But you have to admit, there are a lot of cases where…
Female Student: Yeah, I know. Cases where people decide they have to move out, but, well, nobody moves out just because they don’t have the same interest as their roommate. Maybe they have very different schedules.
Male Student: Or they have a chance to move to a better location.
Female Student: Yeah, anyway, my point is that there is no reason to expect a big drop. People are still gonna want to move.
Male Student: For all kinds of reasons.
