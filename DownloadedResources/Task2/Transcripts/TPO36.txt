Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
Woman: Did you see this letter in the paper?
Man: Yeah but I don't think it's a good idea.
Woman: Why not?
Man: 'Cause I think students will pay even less attention to the professor, not more. I think it'd be too much distraction.
Woman: How so?
Man: Well maybe some students would actually use laptops to take notes.
Woman: I would.
Man: OK, you would. But a lot of people, most people would be too busy playing around instead. You know, surfing the internet, emailing friends, playing computer games, that kind of stuff.
Woman: Huh, so you really think they pay less attention.
Man: Yeah, I think that's what would happen.
Woman: Alright, but what about her second point? Don't you think if students have them in class, the professor would be able to use the internet as a teaching tool?
Man: Well the problem with that is that not everyone has a laptop computer, only some people have one.
Woman: True.
Man: So you see, not everyone would be able to follow along. It wouldn't be useful as a teaching tool if only some students could follow along but not others.
Woman: I see what you mean.
