Now, listen to two students discussing the article.
(man) What do you think of the proposal?
(woman) I think it'll work. I mean, the range of the station now is basically limited to the campus. So it's basically just a few programs mainly for students.
(man) Yeah?
(woman) Well, if this proposal goes through there will be more programs and it'll give the students more professional experience as they expand withprogramming for a much larger, you know, real-life audience. And stuff like that will give them a better shot at getting a job after they graduate.
(man) Of course.
(woman) Besides, the whole university will benefit from it.
(man) What do you mean?
(woman) Well, you know my friend Tony, right? He told me that the radio station at his university did something like this about five years ago.
(man) And?
(woman) Well, it's a success! They are making a lot of money out of commercials and they are using it to offer more scholarships and to help fund projects to renovate the facilities of other programs.
(man) That sounds really good."
