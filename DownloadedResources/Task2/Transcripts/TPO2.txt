NarratorNow listen to two students discussing the article.
Man:I don't like the university's plan.
Woman:Really? I've ridden those buses, and sometimes there were only a few people on the bus. It did seem like kind of a waste.
Man:I see your point. But I think the problem is the route's out-of-date. It only goes through the neighborhoods that've gotten too expensive for students to live in. It's ridiculous that they haven't already changed the route - you know, so it goes where most of campus students live now. 1 bet if they did that, they'd get plenty of students riding those buses.
Woman:Well, at least they are adding more parking. It's gotten really tough to find a space.
Man:That's the other part I don't like, actually. Cutting back the bus service and adding parking's just gonna encourage more students to drive on campus. And that'll just add to the noise around campus and create more traffic...and that'll increase the need for more parking spaces.
Woman:Yeah, I guess I can see your point. Maybe it would be better if more students used the buses instead of driving.
Man:Right. And the university should make it easier to do that, not harder.
