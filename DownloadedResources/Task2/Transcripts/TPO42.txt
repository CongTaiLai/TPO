Now listen to two students discussing the article.
Man：I just don't know about this decision.
Woman：It sort of makes sense to me.
Man：Not to me. I don't understand their reasoning. I mean, what's wrong with small classes? I think that's what students actually prefer. And it's easy to see why.
Woman：Yeah. You do get to participate more.
Man：Definitely. You can be more actively involved, get more attention and support. It's just a better way to learn.
Woman：Okay. But there is that survey.
Man：I don't know what students they asked, but I know a lot of people who feel just the opposite. I mean, what does experience mean anyway? Sometimes it means you have been teaching the same subject for twenty years and you are probably tired of it by now and maybe not very enthusiastic.
Woman：Yeah. That does happen.
Man：Whereas if it's the first time or maybe second you are teaching a class, well, it's going to be more exciting to you. And you are going to communicate that excitement to the people you are teaching. At least that's how I see it.
