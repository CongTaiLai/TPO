Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
Male Student: Did you see the letter in the paper about the kitchens?
Female Student: Yeah, I did. What did you think?
Male Student: Oh, I really like her ideas. She’s right that no one really cooks in there now. I know I sure don’t after my own experience.
Female Student: What was that?
Male Student: Well, I came back to the dorm one night all wet from getting caught in a rainstorm and I just wanted to warm up with a cup of tea. So I went into the kitchen but all I could find was this battered old teapot that was bent out of shape, and there were no cups around at all.
Female Student: That doesn’t sound like fun.
Male Student: It wasn’t. And frankly, it was so inconvenient that I never used the kitchen again. But having some nice new stuff could make a real difference.
Female Student: And what about her other suggestion? Do you think you’d want to go to them?
Male Student: Oh, definitely. And I think other students would too because a lot of us come here without basic skills. But there are students here who actually know quite a lot about cooking and I’ll bet they would be willing to teach the rest of us what they know.
Female Student: Great idea. It would probably make more students want to go to them.
Male Student: Right. And learning new recipes together would be fun. There are so many cool things to cook.
