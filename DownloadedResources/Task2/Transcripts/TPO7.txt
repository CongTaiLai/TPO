Now listen to two students discussing the article.
(man) Every thing all right?
(woman) Yeah, I'm just upset about that article I showed you this morning.(man) Why? What's the big deal?
(woman) Well, as an art major, I think it's a big loss for the department. The university's got it all wrong.
(man) What do you mean?
(woman) Well, the low enrollment isn't because art majors don't want to take these classes, problem is who has time to take them when there are so many other requirements?
(man) I don't understand.
(woman) See, the classes they're eliminating are all optional. The required courses are mostly painting and drawing, and they take up all our time. What we really need are different requirements. Then art majors could take a better variety of classes, all the things we're interested in.
(man) That makes sense. But the thing about the professor…
(woman) Well, that's true. But still, they're being drastic. If money is the problem, they could hire a part-time professor. Or most of the professors in the department have secondary fields.
(man) Really?
(woman) Yeah! At least a few painting teachers are also great sculptors. I’m sure one of them could teach the class."
