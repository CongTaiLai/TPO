Now listen to two students discussing the article.
(man) So, what do you think of this?
(woman) Well, I think it's a good idea, necessary, too.
(man) Why is that?
(woman) Well, you know, I've actually been up to the admissions office a couple of times, like, to pick up some information for a friend, you know, and every time I've ever been there, wow, you can tell they're really busy.
(man) Oh, really.
(woman) Yeah, those staff members are running around like crazy, on the phone, doing interviews, dealing with tons of paper work, so I can totally believe what they are saying about the time factor, seems like having one less thing to worry about will be a good thing.
(man) Sounds like it.
(woman) Yep, oh, and about the other point,
(man) The, uh, the different perspective thing?
(woman) Uh hum, I think people like us will be really good at this. Unlike, you know, I remember when I was first shown around the campus, the guide leading was, well, he was super nice, but there were some questions that he couldnâ€™t really answer from experience.
(man) Like what?
(woman) Well, practical things, which are the noisier dorms? Or which ones are quietest? Which student cafeteria would he recommend? Stuff he didn't have first-hand knowledge about, I mean, how could he?
(man) I see. Our point of view might be more helpful.
