Now listen to two students discussing the college's plan.
(woman) The college's making a mistake with this new plan.
(man) What do you mean? I think it will really help toaccomplish the college'sgoals.
(woman) Don't' be so sure! All that construction, for two years? It's gonna create a lot of noise.
(man) Well, you mean in the beginning, for students still living in the dorms.
(woman) Yeah, students who are trying to sleep or do works are constantly going to be disturbed. So, people will try to get as far away as possible, probably by moving off campus. So they are losing even more people!
(man) Huh, I haven't thought of that. But still, once all the constructions are over, more people will probably want to live in the dorms, right? I mean, the living conditions will be so much better.
(woman) If they can afford to, do you know how the college is planning on paying for this plan? By raising the cost of campus housing!
(man) Oh! I didn't realize that.
(woman) Yeah, so if itâ€™s more expensive why would people want to move back into the dorms if they can rent an apartment for less money?
