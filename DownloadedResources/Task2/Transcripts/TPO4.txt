Now listen to two students discussing the article.
(man) I just don't think this will work.
(woman) Why not?
(man) Because it's not gonna solve the problem. Students are busy at night, I mean, we have jobs, families, clubs, social events. Most of us already have something to do every single night of the week.
(woman) I see your point. I sure couldn't fit anything into my schedule during the week. I've got swimming practice most nights.
(man) Right! And as far as expense goes, I think they're going about it the wrong way. I mean, it cost money to hire more teachers and keep the academic building open later, which is a lot more expensive than simply just buying more computers.
(woman) More computers?
(man) That's right! Computer prices have come way down the past few years. So the department won't have to spend as much now as they did in the past. Besides, the computer department classrooms, you know, the rooms themselves, they are actually very big, thereâ€™s plenty of space to add more computers.
