Now listen to two students discussing the article.
(woman) You know, I wish they wouldn't do this.
(man) Why?
(woman) Well, I think it's unnecessary, I mean, as far as the first reason goes. Yeah, sure, it takes a long time to have everyone receive their diploma individually, especially now that there are more students, but there's an easy way to make it shorter.
(man) What's that?
(woman) Reduce the number of speeches. I mean, a lot of people give speeches, students, professors, administrators, the president of the university. Do we really need that many speeches?
(man) Probably not, and a lot of the speeches are pretty boring anyway, so, yeah, we probably could cut out a few.
(woman) Yeah, and I don't think their second reason's very good either, about the space.
(man) How's that?
(woman) The problem isn't the size of the hall. It's that they allow students to invite too many people to come and watch. All they need to do is reduce the number of guests each graduating student gets to invite.
(man) Yeah, I guess that could solve the problem.
(woman) Yeah, I mean, right now each graduating student can invite up to ten people. That’s too many. At most schools, students only get to invite like four or five people. It we just said, “OK, you can only invite six people.” That’ll still be more than most other schools and the ceremony could stay the way it is.
