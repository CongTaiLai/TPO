M:I totally agree with the letter.
W:How come? Don’t you think the campus looked pretty at night?
M:Well…it might make the buildings look nice at night but why should we waste so much money on something we really don’t need? Just for looks, there are more important things than that.
W: I can see your point.
M:I mean how long has that library project been going on?
W:Yeah, the whole third floor has been closed for the last few months.
M:Exactly. And just last night, I had my astronomy class with professor Henrik. He told us something that was totally disappointing. We’ve been tracking a comet all semester long and he says if the university’s plan goes through, we won’t be able to see the comet through telescopes anymore.
W:That’s so sad. You chose the school just because of the astronomy program, didn’t you??
M:Yeah, it’s such a good program. But if it’s too bright around here at night, we’ll have to go back to looking at the pictures of comets in the textbook. You could tell Professor Henrik is disappointed too. It’s the hands-on experience that gets everyone all excited.
