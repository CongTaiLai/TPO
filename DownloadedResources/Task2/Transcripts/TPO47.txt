Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
Man：Did you see this?
Woman：Yeah. But I don't think it'll work.
Man：Why not?
Woman：Well, I don't think professors would be too happy to have their teaching styles publicly criticized. Besides they might not even bother reading the online evaluations if they think there will be negative criticism in them.
Man：You really think that will happen?
Woman：Sure. And so the professor won't take them seriously or be influenced in any way. Nothing's going to change.
Man：Okay. But at least students who might take their courses in the future will read them.
Woman：That's true. But students who write the evaluations usually do it on the last day of class. And they're all in a hurry to leave. They don't want to bother spending much time on them, so they don't say anything specific or helpful about the professor or the course.
Man：I see what you mean.
Woman：So this whole idea may not work at all.
