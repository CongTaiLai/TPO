Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
W: Hey Paul! You're an actor, right? What do you think about this idea?
M: I think it's greatÔºÅ
W: Oh yeah?
M: Absolutely! I mean, for the people in town there's sometimes not a lot going on, not a lot to do. There's not even a movie theater nearby and if you want to see a professional show you have to travel. I think the nearest professional theater's like an hour away.
W: Yeah, plus those professional plays can be really expensive. I saw one last semester and the ticket cost me like $40.
M: Right, so it'll be good for people to have another entertainment option; an opportunity to see live shows that won't be so expensive.
W: Sure!
M: Plus it would definitely be helpful for us actors.
W: Yeah?
M: Yeah, because on some nights there's not a lot of people that go; not a lot of people there to watch us, and that can have a bad effect on the show. It might not be as good.
W: Yeah. I can imagine it must be a completely different energy for you and the other actors if the seats are half empty.
M: Exactly. Like if the show was a comedy and it's supposed to be funny, in order for it to really seem funny, there needs to be a lot of people there to laugh at the jokes. Otherwise it just doesn't seem as humorous. Having a crowd there laughing at the jokes really helps the show along; helps it to be good.
W: That makes sense. So this proposal would help that.
M: Yeah, help make it more likely that there'd be a full house; a lot of people watching.
