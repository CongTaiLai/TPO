Now listen to two students discussing the article.
(man) Hey, what do you think of this?
(woman) You mean the editors' decision?
(man) Right.
(woman) I think they are right. It's the thing to do.
(man) Really? Why?
(woman) Well, hardly anyone reads that section.
(man) You don't think so?
(woman) Not really, I mean, they only cover stories and most people already know about them before they even get around to reading the campus paper.
(man) True, if you get the local paper, or use the internet, you already know the major stories.
(woman) Exactly, and the coverage's better. I think we should just stick with campus news and stuff.
(man) So do you think what they're gonna replace with is better?
(woman) Definitely, right now, how do you learn about what's happening on campus?
(man) Mostly from posters in different buildings or in the student center.
(woman) Right, the information is everywhere but it's hard to keep track of it. I see stuff posted but then I forget about it half the time.
(man) So you’re saying that with this new section?
(woman) You could just cut it out from the newspaper and carry it around and check it anytime and know what’s taking place when and where.
