MALE STUDENT: So, what do you think of Robert’s letter?
FEMALE STUDENT:Well, I don’t know how helpful his idea would be.
MALE STUDENT: Really?
FEMALE STUDENT: Yeah. Students should be studying all throughout the semester... not waiting until a few days before exams.
MALE STUDENT: So you don’t think we need this?
FEMALE STUDENT: Right. It’s just gonna encourage students to wait and do all of their studying at the end of the semester. You just can’t learn it all in a few days.
MALE STUDENT: Okay. But what about the other point he mentioned?
FEMALE STUDENT: Oh, that? I don’t think that’s the best time to be asking professors questions about the courses.
MALE STUDENT: Why not?
FEMALE STUDENT: Well, professors are really busy during that period with grading homework assignments and preparing the exams. They might not have time to answer students’ questions. It’d be pretty hard to make appointments with professors at that time, don’t you think?
MALE STUDENT: Yeah, they might just not have enough time.
