Now listen to two students discussing the article
Woman：It's really too bad about this new policy.
Man：Why do you say that?
Woman：Well, I mean, you don't notice it so much now, but if you take a good look at that building, it's pretty boring, just your basic square building with gray concrete walls and no kind of ornamentation or anything to make it interesting.
Man：Yes. I guess that's true now that I think about it.
Woman：Yeah. The stuff that goes up there now, a lot of it is artistic and colorful, it gives the building character and personality.
Man：True.
Woman：Plus, it's always changing and that's cool too.
Man：Yeah. You are right.
Woman：So what's gonna be left? A boring old concrete wall.
Man：Yeah. I guess it will be kind of plain.
Woman：Yeah. And the idea about the dining hall.not everybody eats there. A lot of students eat at the Snack Bar or off campus. Some students bring lunch from home and eat outside under the trees.
Man：That's true. I never eat in the dining hall.
Woman：Okay. See what I mean? So how are you going to see those announcements?
Man：I won't.
Woman：I rest my case.
