(man) Hey, did you read about this plan?
(woman) Yeah, and I think it's really a great idea.
(man) Why's that?
(woman) Well, a lot of new students really need this, I mean, it's not just about getting extra help with the course material, they'll probably also get information about things like taking notes or the best way to study for exams.(man) Yeah, I barely even knew how to do those things when I first came here.(woman) Neither did I. So these are things most students wind up having to learn on their own at first. That's why so many of them have a hard time.(man) And it's probably good that they can work with somebody who has the same interests.
(woman) Right, that will be a real advantage: to get information about the classes you're gonna need to take from somebody who's already taken those classes. And they could recommend professors and tell you who the best advisers in the department are, things like that.(man) I see what you mean, so new students could get access to information about the program from another studentâ€™s point of view.
(woman) Exactly!
