Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
(man) Mary, you're an art student. What do you think of this letter?
(woman) I don't like the idea.
(man) Why not?
(woman) Well, first of all, his first point about a lot of people passing through the student center, that's true, but..
(man) But?
(woman) But it's always crowded with people coming and going. It's not good for showing artwork. Imagine you're standing there, trying to look at the painting, it's gonna be like a million people walking through. People walking in front of you, blocking your view, distracting you.
(man) Hmmm. Yeah, I haven't thought of it.
(woman) You won't be able to appreciate the artwork or get a good look at anything with so much going on, with so many people moving around.
(man) Yeah, I see what you mean.
(woman) Plus, he's wrong about the windows.
(man) But isn't it true that it's good for art to have lots of light?
(woman) In a sense, yeah, but that kind of light, all that natural light from windows, that’s actually not good, because if it’s really sunny out it will be way too bright, if it’s cloudy, it will be way too dark.
(man) Oh!
(woman) What you want is controlled light, consistent light, the kind you get from electrical light bulb. Think about in an art museum. In an art museum, you've got electric lighting and the light is always carefully controlled, always at the same level.
