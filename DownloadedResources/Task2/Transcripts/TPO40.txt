Now listen to two students discussing the article.
Woman：Hey, it's nice that they're gonna do this.
Man：It's not a bad idea, but do you think it'll accomplish what they're hoping?
Woman：Sure. I mean, the dormitories all have their own lounges, and think about how much time students spend there, and how many people they meet.
Man：Yeah. I got to know a lot of people in my dorm during my first semester just watching TV and taking study breaks in the lounge.
Woman：Right. Those dorm lounges are really central to student life. And I met people there that really helped me with my schoolwork too. Students who live off campus don't have anything like that.
Man：That's true.
Woman：Plus, I like the idea of posting stuff. You know, things like notices from students who want to get together with other students to share car rides to campus.
Man：Yeah. Rideshare information could be helpful.
Woman：Absolutely! If students knew about rideshares, they could save money getting to campus cuz a few of them could travel in one car.
