Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
(woman) I totally disagree with Tim's proposal.
(man) Why?
(woman) Well, look, Tim's my friend but he's not your typical student. He stays up late partying every night, week nights, too.
(man) If he parties every night no wonder he can't pay attention.
(woman) Yes, and most students aren't like that. They come to class prepared and rested and they can concentrate.
(man) So, you're saying that problem is really Tim.
(woman) Yes. He was in one of my classes last year and whenever I looked at him he was actually sleeping.
(man) I guess if he was sleeping, he can't really know what's happening, what other people in class are doing.
(woman) Right! And you want to know what does happen in that last hour of seminar? In a lot of seminars that I've been in, that's when things get interesting.
(man) Really?
(woman) Yes, that's usually when students get really involved in the discussion and start exchanging important ideas, and if the History department actually did what Tim suggests, well if they did that, what would happen is youâ€™d lose what might be the most worthwhile part of the seminar.
