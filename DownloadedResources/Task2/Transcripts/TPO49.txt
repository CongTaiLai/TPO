Narrator: Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
Man: Hey, did you see Alexandra’s letter?
Girl: Yeah, what do you think?
Man: Well, it’s great. She really makes some good points, like the thing with the university bookstore is, if you buy a brand new textbook, it can be pretty expensive and they usually have only a few used textbooks around. They’re cheaper of course, but they sell out quickly.
Girl: That’s true.
Man: So this would give students time to look around on their own. You know, maybe they could find the books they need online, get books a few months ahead of time using the internet.
Girl: I agree.
Man: So this way students might be able to save a little money.
Girl: Right, so what do you think about the second point, about the reading assignment?
Man: I agree with that, too. It just makes a lot of sense, because things get really busy when the semester first starts and it can be hard to find time to keep up with all of the assignments, but students usually have some free time right before the start of the semester.
Girl: So we’d have a good opportunity to do some preparation.
Man: Exactly.
