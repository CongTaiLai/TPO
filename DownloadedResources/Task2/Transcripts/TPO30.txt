Now listen to two students discussing the letter:
Man: So, Jane, what do you think of Eric's proposal?
Woman: I'm all for it.
Man: So you think it's true? What he says about the problems about the way it's being done?
Woman: Yeah, I do. Take his first reason. Like, I know you don't drive, but I do drive here everyday, so I need a place to park my car. And remember last year when they decided to repair some of the parking lots?
Man: Oh yeah, I remember that, there was a lot of work going on, wasn't there? Starting in December.
Woman: Right, at least four lots were closed, and that meant there weren't enough parking spots for students and professor's cars. I usually had to circle around looking for parking on one of the streets. And then walk from the street all the way to my classes.
Man: That's annoying.
Woman: Yeah, and it happened to a lot of other people in my classes too! People were always arriving late because of the trouble they had parking. Sometimes even my professors were late.
(man) Yeah.
(woman) And also, his second point? That makes sense too. I mean, for instance, part of the reason those parking lot repairs last year took so long was because of the big snowstorms. They had to keep stopping, sometimes for a week or two at a time, because of snow and ice on the ground.
(man) Yeah, I remember that, we had a bunch of snowstorms in a row last year.
(woman) Yeah, so with all that starting and stopping cause of the weather, the problem took them a lot longer to finish.
