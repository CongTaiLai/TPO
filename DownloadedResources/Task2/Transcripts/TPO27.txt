Now listen to two students discussing the article.
(woman) Oh, no, did you see this?
(man) Yeah, why? You don't like the idea?
(woman) Not at all!
(man) How come?
(woman) Well, the cost, for one thing, they are just not being realistic.
(man) Even compare to the price of textbooks?
(woman) Well, sure, textbooks aren't cheap, but do you think people are only gonna use one device the whole time they are at university? What happens if yours breaks? You have to buy a new one. Or they come out with some fancy new features. Wouldn't you want to get a new one then?
(man) Yeah, I see what you mean. A lot of people would probably want to replace theirs with the latest version.
(woman) Right! Maybe even every year and that can add up.
(man) True, but, don't you agree it'll make studying and preparing for classes a lot easier?
(woman) I don't think everybody is gonna think it's so great.
(man) What do you mean?
(woman) Well., it's only helpful if it’s easy to use and, well, this thing is pretty small. It’s only about 18 or 20 centimeters tall.
(man) Oh, really? So that means the screen’s pretty small.
(woman) Right, and I heard that the key pad or control buttons, they are small, too. So if you have normal-sized fingers, it’s not so easy to select an item or get it to function right, you know, to do stuff like highlighting or underlining.
(man) I hadn’t thought of that.
(woman) So what good are all those fancy features if it’s hard to use them? Besides, I like the old-fashioned way of studying material: writing notes on the page and underlining or highlighting important sections of the book. I’m more comfortable with that. "
