Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
Man: Did you see this letter Molly?
Woman: Yeah, but I don't agree with him.
Man: Why not?
Woman: Well it might have some educational benefit for the people doing it, but overall for the other students who are actually taking the classes, it wouldn't be good.
Man: How come?
Woman: Because anyone who is taking the class for a grade, for credit, puts in a lot of time preparing for it, doing the reading and assignments; whereas people who aren’t, they might not be as well prepared. And that would have affected the quality of class discussion.
Man: You mean the discussions wouldn’t be on very high level?
Woman: Right. Because people who aren't taking the class for a grade would be asking really basic questions. They’ll be slowing down the class discussion by taking time to discuss basic stuff that is already covered in reading assignments.
Man: That’s a good point. I can see how that might happen.
Woman: Plus, he’s wrong about the work required about the professor.
Man: But it’s true that the professor doesn't need to grade anything.
Woman: Sure, but there are a lot of other little things that can add up to more work. Like they have to prepare for extra handouts for the class, learn extra names, and, well, possibly stay after class to answer those students’ questions.
Man: Yeah, I guess that’s extra work.
Woman: Absolutely. All these little things add up and require the professor’s attention.
