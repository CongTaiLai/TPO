Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
(woman) Did you see this letter, Jen?
(man) Yeah.
(woman) Be kind of nice to do that, huh?
(man) No, actually, I don't think it's a good idea.
(woman) Why not?
(man) Well, like the part about how it'll help students concentrate, I mean, maybe a little snack will help the person who's eating it, but, the trouble is that it makes it hard for everyone else to concentrate cause they have to listen to someone munching on chips, or biting into an apple, or crinkling paper wrappers.
(woman) I guess it can be kind of disruptive.
(man) Yeah! It will interfere with everyone's concentration. You wouldn't be able to pay attention with all the noises going on.
(woman) OK, I guess I will have to agree with you on that, but what about her other reason? It would be nice to be able to have some fun at the end of the semester, right?
(man) No, there's a problem with that, too.
(woman) Why?
(man) Well, I don’t think it’s appropriate to use class time for that kind of thing. I mean, the last class is usually pretty important, that’s when we do a lot of reviewing for final exams.
(woman) True!
(man) If we use that time for that, we probably wouldn't have time to do as much reviewing, which means we wouldn't be as well prepared for exams.
(woman) Yeah, I haven’t thought of that.
