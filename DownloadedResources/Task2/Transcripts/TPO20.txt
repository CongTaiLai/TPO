Now listen to two students discussing the article.
(woman) What on earth is the university thinking?
(man) Huh? What do you mean?
(woman) Well, those buildings aren't just used for classes. That's where my evening study group usually meets.
(man) Oh, of course, that's true. But you could go to the library instead.
(woman) Yeah, but the library only has a few rooms that people can use for group meetings which is why classrooms are so convenient. But now, if it's winter and cold, where can we go?
(man) Right! In the middle of winter, forget it! Or even it's just kind of cold out.
(woman) It'd be pretty unpleasant.
(man) Oh, but still, they obviously have to do something about the situation.
(woman) Oh, I agree. They have to do something but they should find a solution that isn't so disruptive, to academics no less.
(man) Such as?
(woman) Well, for one, if they replaced all those old windows, they are so drafty. They let the cold in.And if they insulated the buildings better, these are really old buildings. Charming, but,
(man) But not at all energy-efficient, yeah, you’re probably right.
(woman) There’re some really basic improvements they can make that’ll make a huge difference in the long term that can solve the problem and still leave us somewhere to study.
