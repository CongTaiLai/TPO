I think the university should invite a business leader to speak at this year's graduation ceremony - perhaps an executive from one of the large corporations in the area. For students, business leaders are excellent role models because they represent the meaning of professional success. They influence people every day, make important decisions, and have achieved impressive salaries. Furthermore, inviting a business executive will help reinforce to the community that our business program is the biggest and best one in the state. Prospective students will read about the speech and will remember that our university has a strong and attractive business program.
Sincerely,
Ryan Brown
