Students always have to wait until the beginning of the semester to find out which textbooks they will need for their new courses. But since a lot of students register early for their courses, I think that the list for each course should be available immediately at the time of registration.This would give students more time to shop around to find less expensive textbooks. And it would also allow them to start work on the reading for their new courses early.
