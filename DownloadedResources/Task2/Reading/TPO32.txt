Students who fly home for the winter and spring breaks need to get to and from the airport, which is a half-hour drive from campus. I think the university should run a free bus service for students between campus and the airport during the breaks. This would help the students, since there is no public transportation between campus and the airport. In order to provide service to the airport, some of the buses that normally run between campus buildings when classes are in session could run between the school and the airport during the school breaks.
Sincerely,
