Like many people, I was happy when the university opened a coffeehouse. A good coffeehouse is a perfect place to meet people or to study while having a coffee. Unfortunately, our coffeehouse usually empty, so itâ€™s not a good place to meet people And the lighting there is very poor, so it's not a good place to study, either. A coffeehouse seemed like a great idea, but it just hasn't worked out, and the time has come for the university to close it.
Sincerely,
Marvin Baker
