I think the university should consider building a parking lot near the humanities building. Right now there's only street parking available, and it isn't enough. Whenever I look for a spot to park in the street near the humanities building, I can't find one. A parking lot for the humanities building would solve that problem. Also, there's a wooded area behind the building that would make an ideal location for the parking lot. The university could just clear away the trees and build a lot - the space is already there for it.
Sincerely,
Joe Simmons
