The university requires students to complete written evaluations of their professors at the end of each course taught during the semester. But current system is private, since only the professors actually read the evaluations once the students submit them. I suggest that the university publish these evaluation online for everyone to read. Both professors and students would benefit from having these evaluation published. Professor would feel more motivated to improve their teaching if they knew that their evaluations were publicly available to all students. In addition, prospective students could read the evaluation and make more informed decisions about which classes they want to take.
Sincerely,
