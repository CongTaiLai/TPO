The final project for this course will be an oral presentation. Students must work with an assigned partner to select a topic and complete all related research for the project. The partners will orally present their research to the class during the last two weeks of classes. This project will provide students with the opportunity to discover the rewards and challenges of working with another individual, an experience that will help them in future endeavors. Furthermore, these presentations will benefit the entire class: when students share their discoveries with the class, they enable other students to learn from their work.
