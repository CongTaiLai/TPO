I noticed that there are bicycles locked to the campus bicycle racks that have not been moved for a long time. I think the university should remove these bikes from the racks and dispose of them. I recommend this action because, first of all, they will not be missed by anyone, since they apparently have been forgotten by their owners. More important, removing the bikes would help to free up space on the racks, thereby benefiting people who are actually using their bikes and need places to park them.
