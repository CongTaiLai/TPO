The university now schedules one study day at the end of every semester for students to prepare for final exams. I suggest that the university consider extending this study period to three days. Most students have exams in several classes. Having only one study day between the end of classes and the beginning of the final exam period is not enough time to prepare for all of the exams. Additionally, having a three-day study period will give students extra time to consult with their professors if they need help or advice before the exam period begins.
