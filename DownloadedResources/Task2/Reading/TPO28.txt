Currently, the campus music building – which has practice rooms students can reserve for playing instruments – closes nightly at nine p.m. I think the university should keep the building open until midnight. Often, student musicians want to practice their instruments later at night, and right now there’s no good place for them to do that. Also, lots of students want to use the practice rooms, so it’s often difficult to reserve one. If the building were open more hours, though, it would be easier to accommodate the large number of students who want to reserve rooms.
