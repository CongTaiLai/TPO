The administration has plans to acquire a new sculpture for campus. We should all oppose this plan. The university's poor financial condition led it to increase the price for campus housing and tuition by 15% this past year. Surely then it is no financial position to purchase such an expensive sculpture. Moreover, just look at the sculpture: several 60-foot ling steel plates, jutting out of the earth at odd angles! It's so large, it'll take up all the green space in front of the campus center! This is public space that should be reserved for students to use.
