Thanks to our superb theater program here at the university, we are fortunate to be able to see many plays that are put on by student actors. However, while all employees and students at the university may attend these plays for free, anyone who is not directly associated with the university must play a fee to attend. I think student plays should be open to everyone free of charge. That way, people in the local community could benefit from having a free entertainment opinion in town. It would also be good for the student actors, since it would help to ensure larger audiences at the plays.
Sincerely, Marie Jones
