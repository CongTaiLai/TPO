The university will begin switching from traditional-bound textbooks to electronic textbooks early next year. University students will be able to download the content of their required textbooks to a reading device and read the material directly from the deviceâ€™s screen. While the cost of the device is around $200, it is a one-time expense. Considering the rising cost of textbooks, students will save money in the long run since purchasing electronic books for their classes is much less expensive than buying regular textbooks. Furthermore, the university believes the device will be an effective study aid because it is simple to operate and offers features such as highlighting of text and note-taking.
