New Degree Navigator Web Site

Students must complete certain courses in their fields of study in order to meet the requirements for graduation. Currently, students meet with academic advisors to discuss these requirements. Soon,though,students will be able to use a new degree navigator Web site to keep track of their requirements. The Web site will make it easier for students to monitor which courses they have already completed and which ones they still need to take before graduating, so they can plan their schedules accordingly.Also, the Web site will help reduce the workload for academic advisors, who will not need to meet with students as often.
