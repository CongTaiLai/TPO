Cafe to be Built in Library

The university has decided to build a cafe in the basement of the library.The reason given for this new development is that university officials believe students will enjoy the convenience of being able to eat without having to leave the library. Students have often complained that their studies are disrupted because they must leave the library whenever they want to eat. Officials also believe that it will help make library study more productive if students have the opportunity to take short breaks in the cafe while theyâ€™re working.

Sincerely, Justin Ruben
