Many universities allow students to audit classes. That is, students may attend lectures and discussions for a particular class without completing the assignments, receiving a grade, or earning credit for the class. I think our university should allow this. Auditing classes would be good for interested students, since they would be able to learn more and experience a variety of different classes that they would not otherwise be able to take. Furthermore, it shouldn't create any difficulties or additional obligations for professors, because these students wouldn't take tests or white papers that need to be graded.
Sincerely,
