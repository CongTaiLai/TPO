Sometimes two different species of insects live close together, side by side. The two insect groups might even share the same home. But the two species often are different enough that they do not have to compete for the same resources, and therefore they can avoid conflict. This is known as compound nesting. Compound nesting actually provides advantages to both species, because living closely together can result in a specific benefit to each group, benefits that increase both speciesâ€™ chances of survival.
