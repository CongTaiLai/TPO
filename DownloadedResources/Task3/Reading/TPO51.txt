When companies advertise a product, they depend on the use of images as well as words to achieve their goal of increasing sales. An image can be a symbol, character, or design - any visual figure or representation that will link the company with their product in the consumer's mind. Typically the image is a positive, entertaining one that consumers enjoy so much that it makes them want to buy the product in the future. The image also tends to be easy to remember even though it is usually something not normally or logically associated with the product.
