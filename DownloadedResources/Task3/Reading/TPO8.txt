Many animals use coloration to protect themselves from predators. One defensive strategy involving the use of coloration is what is known as revealing coloration. Animals employing this strategy have an area of bright color on some part of their body, this bright color is usually hidden from predatorsâ€™ view. When approached by a predator, the animal suddenly reveals the area of bright color, this unexpected display of color startles or confuses the predator and provides the would-be-prey with an opportunity to escape.
