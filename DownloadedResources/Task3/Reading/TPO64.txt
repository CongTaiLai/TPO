Paradox of ChoiceThe freedom to make choices and decisions makes people happy because it gives them a sense of being in control of their lives.However, the fact that having some choice is good does not mean that having more choice is necessarily better, since having too many choices can cause anxiety and dissatisfaction.The main reason for this is that as the number of options available to us increases, the effort required to make a good decision increases as well. This phenomenon has been termed the paradox of choice:we like having choices and think that having more choices should please us;but instead, it causes us distress.
