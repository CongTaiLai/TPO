Commitment DevicePeople often have certain goals they want to accomplish in the future. However, their immediate desires can interfere with their ability to accomplish these long-term goals. Psychologists have found that when there is a conflict between immediate desires and long-term goals, it may be helpful to use a commitment device. A commitment device is a plan or arrangement that people make in advance to ensure that, if a conflict occurs, they will continue working toward their long-term goals instead of choosing to satisfy immediate desires. A commitment device forces people to act in their own long-term best interests, increasing their chances of successfully reaching their goals.
