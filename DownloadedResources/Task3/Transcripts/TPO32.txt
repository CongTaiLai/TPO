Now listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a Psychology class.
ProfessorOK, so an example of this from my own life: five or six years ago, I was helping a friend of mine decide on a house to buy. He had been in the market to buy a house and he had it narrowed down to this one house that he was interested in. What he really liked about this house was it had an excellent location. It was in a great place that was actually in the same part of town where he was working right up the street from his job. So he wouldn't have far to drive to get to work which he really liked. However, the downside of this house was that it was smaller than what he was hoping to buy. He wanted to buy sort of a big house and this house just wasn't that big. So it was a tough decision. But my friend eventually did decide to buy the house. And a few years after he made the purchase, I remember, we were talking about the decision and why he decided to buy the house. He told me, well, of course, it was because of the house’s location. He told me how happy he was with the fact it was so close to his work, how great it was only few minutes from his job. I said, “Yes, but, what about its size? Do you still think the house is kind of small?” And he looked at me kind of surprised, “Small? What do you mean small?” Like he didn’t know what I was talking about. The house’s size, a couple of years after buying it, just didn’t seem to be on his mind anymore.
