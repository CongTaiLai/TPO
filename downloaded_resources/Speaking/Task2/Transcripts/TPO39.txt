Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
M: Ellen, you drive to campus, right? Did you see this letter in the paper today?
W: Yeah, I did. I think it makes a lot of sense, so it'd be great if the university starts something like that.
M: OK...
W: Well, now I drive to campus all by myself and buy gas now and then. It isn't much each time I fill the tank, but it adds up.
M: I'm sure.
W: So, a program like that would really help students. They'd spend less on gas and it’s not just gas either. It’s also the wear and tear on the car. I mean the more you use a car going back and forth all the time, the more you have to do maintenance and repairs.
M: Right, but do you think the program would have that other benefit?
W: I do because there have been a lot more people coming into this city, so there's much more traffic now than before and all the carbon dioxide that comes from all those cars on the road is polluting the environment more and more.
M: So, with this program...
W: Right. There'd be less carbon dioxide pouring out into the air and this would reduce environmental pollution and the air quality would certainly improve.
