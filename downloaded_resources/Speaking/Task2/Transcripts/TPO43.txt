Now listen to two students discussing the article.
Man：Interesting, isn't it? I wish they'd made this change two years ago, when we got here. This program is gonna be much more attractive this way, to lots more people.
Woman：Why?
Man：Well, it's a question of choice. See, not everyone likes the same things. The way it used to be...if, like, you didn't like sleeping in a tent, well, you just didn't participate. Lots of people didn't.
Woman：That's true. I didn't go on the camping trip my first year. Hiking and camping isn't my thing. But you know, I did feel I missed out on something.
Man：Right. Plus, the other reason this is going to work is that you don't have to give up your whole weekend anymore. There are other things people need to do the first few days, you know, like, buy their books, set up their rooms, prepare for the first day of classes, that kind of thing. The big time commitment used to get in the way.
