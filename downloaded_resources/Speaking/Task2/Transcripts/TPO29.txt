Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
(woman) He's totally right about this, you know?
(man) Well, I agree they should do it, but maybe it's not fair.
(woman) What? Just assuming no one wants them? Well, judging from the conditions some of them are in, I think it's probably a safe assumption. I mean, some are missing parts like handlebars or wheels, and others are really rusty like they've been left outside in the rain for years.
(man) Yeah, the ones with missing parts sure don't look like they are being used but what if some are?(woman) Well, to be sure, the university could always attach notes to them and say give the owners two weeks to remove them or they'd be removed by campus security.
(man) Yeah, that'll probably work.
(woman) Anyway, it'll be really big help if they were gone.
(man) Oh, I know
(woman) Because, I mean, especially like in front of the dining hall, there are lots of them there and it can be really hard to find a space. All the spaces are always taken there.
(man) Yeah, it’s bad. Lots of people ride bikes these days.
(woman) And since the university doesn't allow us to tie them to signposts, or fences or anything like that to park them, I always have to lock mine up in another building and walk over to the dining hall cause there’s hardly ever a space."
