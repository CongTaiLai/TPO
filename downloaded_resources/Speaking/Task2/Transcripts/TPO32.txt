Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
(woman) Did you see this, Jim? What do you think about her idea?
(man) I think it’d be great. It’d make things much less expensive cause our campus is located outside the city. If you can’t get a friend with a car to give you a ride, there is no other way to get to the airport. And your only choice is to take a taxi.
(woman) I know. I’ve had to take a taxi before and it’s pretty expensive.
(man) Yeah, like thirty or forty dollars which is a lot especially for students.
(woman) Yeah, definitely
(man) And I think it would work what she’s suggesting. I mean, there is less need for buses on campus during that time to take students between the buildings.
(woman) You mean because classes are over then?
(man) Yeah, exactly, there might some final exams still going on but regular classes won’t be meeting. There are much fewer students left on campus and they don’t need to get around campus that often.
(woman) Yeah, I guess they’re just making occasional trips to take exams or go to the library or gym or whatever.
(man) Right, it shouldn’t cause any problems for anyone who still needs to get around campus.
