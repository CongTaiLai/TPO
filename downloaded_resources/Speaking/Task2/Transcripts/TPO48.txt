Listen to two students discussing the letter.
Woman：Did you see this letter?
Man：Yeah. It's a nice idea, but it'll never happen.
Woman：Why do you say that?
Man：Well, first of all, you can get on a bus right here on campus and in half an hour, you are downtown at the county art museum.
Woman：That's true.
Man：And if you show you student ID card, it only costs like two bucks to get in.
Woman：Yeah. In fact, on Mondays, students get in for free.
Man：Right. And you can see some of the greatest art in the world there. For example, you know Rembrandt, the famous Dutch painter?
Woman：Yeah.
Man：Well, right now they're showing something like twenty of his paintings.
Woman：Wow!
Man：Yeah. And you know, it's true. We do have a lot of very generous alumni. But we're already asking them for help building a new student center and a new library. And those are both very expensive projects.
Woman：Yeah. That's right.
Man：So I don't think we can expect them to donate much money for anything else anytime soon, especially for something we don't really need.
