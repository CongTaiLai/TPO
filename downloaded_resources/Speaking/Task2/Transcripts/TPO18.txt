Now listen to two students discussing the article.
(woman) Jim, you're in the choir, right? What do you think about what they are doing next year? This article?
(man) I really like it.
(woman) Yeah?
(man) Yeah! The new director is right that it'll motivate us.
(woman) How's that?
(man) Well, some of the other schools are really good, so we'll really have to work hard to go up against them.
(woman) Yeah!
(man) I mean, right now, we don't rehearse more than once a week. But if we know we'd be competing with other schools, we'd probably rehearse more often and improve our singing the line.
(woman) That's true, uh, the more you practice the better you get. So, uh, what about the article said about how this will help the program?
(man) I hope it works. Right now, the program is pretty small but we have some really talented people and it would be great to attract even more people.
(woman) So, how would this plan help?
(man) Well, if we go to these off campus events and other people hear us and think we are really good, we might be able to get some new students interested in coming to this university, to be a part of our music program and perform in our choir concerts. 
(woman) You’re right! I haven’t really thought about that.
