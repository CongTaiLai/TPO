Now listen to two students discussing the article in the newspaper.
Female student: I don't like the university's plan.
Male student: really? Why not?Female student：Well, even though we won't have to leave the library, that's just the problem. Nobody's gonna feel like walking all the way over to the cafeteria, especially when the weather's bad. They'll just run down to the basement to eat.
Male student：I don't understand. Isn't that a good thing?
Female student：No. Because in the library they're just gonna serve a bunch of unhealthy snacks, sandwiches and sweets and soda. So students will just eat junk. At least the cafeteria has some healthy food.
Male student：Okay, I see what you mean. Yeah, I probably wouldn't walk over to the cafeteria either.
Female student：And I think they're wrong about another thing. If I'm in the library and I know my friends are down in the basement chatting, I'm gonna be tempted to go down there and hang out with them. You know what I mean? I'm sure I'm not the only one who be tempted to go down there and chat. How's anybody gonna concentrate on doing actual work?
Male student：Yeah. Good point. This whole thing might backfire.
