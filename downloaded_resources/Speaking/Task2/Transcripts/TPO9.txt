NARRATOR
Now listen to two students discussing the announcement.
MALE STUDENT
Did you read this announcement?
FEMALE STUDENT
Yeah, and I disagree—I don’t think it will actually help students.
MALE STUDENT
Really? Why not?
FEMALE STUDENT
Well, they talked about leadership... and organizational skills... but that’s not really the kind of work you do. Like my older brother’s had the kind of jobs they’re talking about... and typically you’re just there to do basic tasks like typing or filing stuff—nothing very meaningful.
MALE STUDENT
Oh, so you wouldn’t actually learn anything new...
FEMALE STUDENT
Exactly.
MALE STUDENT
I guess I see what you mean—but what about the other point they make?
FEMALE STUDENT
About this helping us after we graduate? I don’t agree.
MALE STUDENT
How come?
FEMALE STUDENT
Well, the problem is that there are lots of other universities in our area that have the same requirement . . . so there are lots of other students at these positions.
MALE STUDENT
Yeah, I guess I hadn’t thought of that.
FEMALE STUDENT
So even if you take a position like this in a company while you’re still a student, once you graduate, the competition for permanent jobs will be impossible...I mean, there just won’t be enough jobs available for all the business graduates in this city who will be looking for full-time work.
MALE STUDENT
Hmm … I see what you’re saying.
