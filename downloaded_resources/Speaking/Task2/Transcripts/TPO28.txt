Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
(woman): Jim, did you see this letter in the paper today?
(man): Yeah, I did.
(woman): That would be great for us music students. Because I mean, what happens is, students keep practicing in the dorm room because they don't have anywhere else they can go.
(man): Yeah, I've done that myself a bunch of times playing my violin.
(woman): Me too, and I always feel kind of bad about it, because even if you try to keep the volume down, it's still pretty noisy, and other students are nearby in their rooms trying to sleep or study.
(man): That's true.
(woman): And we really could use more time slots, especially just before the big concerts: the winter concert and the spring concert, because everybody from all sections of the orchestra needs to practice then.
(man): I know, I tried to make a reservation to practice before the winter concert, but I couldn't, because other people from the orchestra had already booked every single time slot.
(woman) Exactly, so this would really help.
