Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
(woman) Hey, Ted, you're a runner. Did you see this letter in the paper?
(man) Yeah, I did, and I use those.
(woman) And?
(man) I think it's a terrible idea.
(woman) How come?
(man) Well, she really hasn't thought it through. Like, the thing about making them safer, what's she's not thinking about is the long-term consequence of running on a hard surface.
(woman) What do you mean?
(man) I mean, it's not good for you. It's too hard on your bones and joints. If you run repeatedly on hard surface, it can lead to injuries or, that's what I've been taught anyway, it's better to run on a soft surface. It does less damage to your body.
(woman) Oh, I wasn't aware of that.
(man) Yeah, so actually it wouldn't be safer. And her second point…
(woman) About changing the way they look?
(man) Yeah, I don't think people will like it.
(woman) So they'd use them less?
(man) Yeah, I mean, one of the main reasons people enjoy them now was it’s a way of taking a break from the rest of the campus, from buildings and streets and stuff. It’s, you know, a chance that feels like you’re out in the nature.
(woman) Oh, so you wouldn't bet that effect anymore.
(man) Right! It’d be just like you’re on a regular street or sidewalk. It wouldn't be as relaxing.
