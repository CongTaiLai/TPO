Now listen to two students discussing the assignment.
Woman：I don't know about this.
Man：Why not? Sounds okay to me.
Woman：Thing is: depending on someone else makes me nervous. My roommate had to do a project like this and the other girl didn't show up to meetings, didn't do any research. My roommate had to do everything herself.
Man：That's a drag. I guess if your partner is irresponsible, you are out of luck.
Woman：Exactly. It hurt her grade. I don't want the same thing to happen to me. Right now I'm more concerned with getting a good grade even though I know that's not the lesson the professor has in mind.
Man：Still, it'll be good to listen to everyone's stuff.
Woman：Well, I don't know. I mean, at the end of the semester, people are focused on studying for exams.
Man：Yeah.
Woman：Who has time to put something like this together when they're busy studying?
Man：True.
Woman：I can't imagine anyone will be able to really do a good job with it. And everyone will be so preoccupied by then that they probably won't listen anyway. I think the professor's gonna be disappointed. And students...well...we'll all just be frustrated by the whole thing.
