Now listen to two students discussing the announcement.
(woman) Did you read about the new plan?
(man) Yeah, what do you think?
(woman) I think it's a great idea.
(man) Really? Why?
(woman) Well, I just don't think the newspaper gives the most up-to-date information about activities.
(man) Well, the paper comes out weekly, what's the problem?
(woman) The fact it comes out just once a week is the problem. I read the paper every Monday but then I forget they're having a concert or showing a film or whatever, like on Thursday or Friday. And this will always give a reminder, all on the day of the event.
(man) Yeah, that way you wouldn't forget.
(woman) And, like, if something gets cancelled at the last minute, well, that way you would know and you wouldn't waste time showing up and no one's there.
(man) I haven't thought of that. That would be really helpful. But do you think students are actually gonna read the e-mail?
(woman) Are you kidding? Everyone checks their e-mail at least once a day. And if maybe they’ll also include the cafeteria menu for the day in the e-mail, well, then people are definitely gonna read it.
(man) You’re so right! I can’t wait until they start.
