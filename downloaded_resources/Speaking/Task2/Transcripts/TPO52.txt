Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
Man: Hey, Kala, did you see Ryan’s letter in the paper?
Woman: Yeah. But I have to say I disagree with his proposal.
Man: Oh, yeah?
Woman: You know, it seems like it’s always business people who speak at graduation, at least every year I’ve been here, it’s always business person speaking.
Man: Think we could do some variety?
Woman: I think other professions can be considered, influential and successful, like say teachers.
Man: Teachers are certainly influential and have an important role in the community.
Woman: Yeah. The school should consider having someone from another profession speak since business leaders always do it.
Man: Yeah. But what about his point about it being good for the business program?
Woman: Well, like Ryan said, that program is already quite big and well-known. It doesn’t really need the extra attention or free advertising that a graduation speaker would bring.
Man: En…That’s true.
Woman: I think our education program could really benefit from the free publicity. It’s a great teacher training program but it’s not as well-known. It’d be great if local teachers could draw attention to it, which would definitely happen in a speech like that.
