Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
W: Hey Jimmy! Did you read this?
M: I did, yeah. What do you think about it?
W: I don't know. I don't think it'd be a very good idea.
M: Oh yeah? But it's true that a lot of us have our own phones.
W: Yeah, but it's good to have both. The service we get with our own phones isn't always reliable. Maybe it's because there're a lot of hills around here, but my service doesn't work that well in this area. A lot of times calls get cut off where the reception isn't good. I can't hear the person on the other line.
M: Yeah, I've had some friends say that too actually.
W: So it's good to have a backup option; something we can use if our own phones aren't working.
M: I see what you mean, but when you think of the money...
W: Well if I don't buy his argument there either because I don't know if you've noticed this on the housing bill we get from the university, but right now we only pay per call.
M: Oh really?
W: Yeah, so if you don't make many calls, you don't pay much. I mean, if you use it a lot of course you'll pay more, but students can avoid that if they just avoid using it as much as possible.
M: Oh, I see. Ok...
W: So, I think they should just keep it the way it is now.
