Now, listen to two students discussing the article.
Male student:Hey, this is great. Did you see this article?
Female student:Oh Yeah, I saw that. But do you think we really needed it?
Male student:Well, Yeah I think it'll be really helpful because there's actually a lot of different classes you need for some of the degree programmes. And it can be hard to stay organized.
Female student:I guess that's true. I'm studying business and there are a lot of math and economics courses I have to take.
Male student:Right. And sometimes students miss a certain course. Like my friend had to stay on campus over the summer break after his final year to take a class to complete his history degree. He had to graduate a few months later.
Female student:Oh Wow His graduation was delayed?
Male student:Yeah, because he didn’t realize it was something he needed to take until it was too late.
Female student:Wow, well Hopefully this will help people avoid that kind of mistake, since they can just see it online. I guess that’s good for the advisers too.
Male student:Yeah, definitely since they're so busy. I mean all the academic advisors are professors. So they have a lot of other work to do.
Female student:That's true. They don't have a lot of extra time.
Male student:Right. And this way they could have more time to talk to students about more serious issues where students might really need advice, like if students have questions about switching majors or doing an internship.
