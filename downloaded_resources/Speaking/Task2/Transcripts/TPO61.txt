Narrator: Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
Female student: Did you see this letter of just ins in the paper today? I like his idea.
Male student: Yeah, I did see that.
Female student: I think it’s good. It would be a real convenience, because right now the closest place to get something to eat is that the student center, which is all the way across campus.
Male student: You know you’re right about that.
Female student: There just isn’t enough time to leave the math building. Make the long walk to the student center and get back in time for your next class.
Male student: I know what you mean.
Female student: So it will be a great place to just have something to eat. Spend time with friends and slowed down a little in between classes.
Male student: And what about his suggestion about the computers?
Female student: Oh I really like it because most students bring their laptops to classes, especially math classes, and they need to recharge their laptops when they’re not in class.
Male student: Yeah, and there are absolutely no places to do that in the math building because it’s so old.
Female student: Right. So, like if you have a couple of math classes in a row, and sometime in between them, it would be a good place to sit down and recharge your laptop and maybe get some work done at the same time.
