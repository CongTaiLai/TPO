Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
(woman) I don't like his proposal.
(man) Why not? There are never many students there.
(woman) But that's why I like about it, that it's never crowded.
(man) Really?
(woman) Yeah, so it's a great place to study. I go there a lot. I'll read a book or bring my laptop computer and work on a paper for class. It's never very noisy.
(man) You're able to get work done there?
(woman) Absolutely! In fact, I actually prefer it to the library as a place to study, and a lot of other students do, too. We even study for our final exams there, and you can eat there while you work, something you can't do with the library.
(man) OK, but you don't actually like the food there, do you? I mean, he said.
(woman) Well, I don't think he's been there recently, I mean, it's true that it wasn't that great in the past, but I think it's a lot better now.
(man) What's changed?
(woman) They have a new manager and I guess she’s made some improvements in the quality of the food. I was there last week and the food was delicious.
(man) Really?
(woman) Yeah, really! And the new manager has also added a lot of really healthful foods and snacks, so the food doesn't just taste good now. It’s good for you, too.
(man) Hmm, I’ll have to try the place.
