Now listen to two students discussing the article.
(man) So what do you think of the university's new plan?
(woman) Oh, I don't know. I don't think it's gonna work.
(man) No?
(woman) I mean, I can't imagine top students being too thrilled about some of the conditions on this campus.
(man) What do you mean?
(woman) Like, the science laboratory having such old outdated equipment and the library needing more books, and the student center being so small. I think that the 2 million could be spent in better places if the university is really serious about achieving its goal.
(man) OK. But what about the other reason for building the stadium? I mean right now we have so little contact with the town.
(woman) Yeah, but this won't help relations. Look, people from town hardly ever come to the games because our teams always lose. And they're not suddenly going to improve over night. Besides, adding seats won't make a difference. I mean, if people from town didn't come before, they wonâ€™t come now just because the place is bigger.
