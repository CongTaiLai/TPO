Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
Woman：I disagree with his idea.
Man：Why? It doesn't sound like if s doing very much business.
Woman：That's probably because he goes during the day, but in the evening...
Man：Oh. People go.
Woman：A lot of people. Students are really busy during the day, with classes, jobs and study. But at night the place is often pretty full. Students get together there all the time.
Man：Really?
Woman：Yeah. It's not until nighttime that students actually have the time to sit down and relax, you know, enjoy a hot drink and something to eat while hanging out or reading for class.
Man：So you can read in there.
Woman：Yeah. I mean, he's right that it used to be a problem, but recently they did some renovations and now I think the lighting is as good as it is in the library.
Man：Really?
Woman：Yeah. And not just at a few tables, just about every table has got good lighting now. Sounds like this guy doesn't know what he's talking about.
Man：Definitely not.
