Male Student: What do you think of this letter?
Female Student: I don’t know if a rule like that would be that helpful. I’m not sure it would really accomplish anything.
Male Student: Really?
Female Student: Yeah，I mean even if they ban those students, kick them off, I’m not sure how much it would help because, sure, those guys cause some of the damage. But the thing is, everybody crosses that lawn every day because it’s so centrally located. So it’s not just those students he is talking about who are responsible.
Male Student: That’s true. I guess it’s right in the middle of all the busiest classroom building.
Female Student: Right. So the lawn gets a lot of traffic. People are in a hurry to get to class and don’t really always walk on the paved paths or sidewalks like they are supposed to. So what Peter suggested in his letter, it wouldn’t solve anything. It would still look pretty terrible.
Male Student: Maybe, but if there’s somewhere else people could play, I mean, that could help a little.
Female Student: But it’s not a good substitute. I mean the gym is practically on the far edge of campus, right? It’s a long walk. What people want is somewhere they can have a little fun in between classes, kick a ball around for 15 minutes or whatever, have some fun after lunch before their next class.
Male Student: Yeah, I guess the idea is not practical if it means you have to take a long walk when you’ve only got a little bit of time to kill.
Female Student: Exactly.
