Now listen to two students discussing the opinion expressed in the letter.
(man) Did you see Paul's letter in the paper about the new sculpture?
(woman) Yeah, but it was totally unconvincing. His reasons for opposing the plan are just totally off. I am glad that we'll finally have some nice art on campus. I'd like to shake the donor's hand and say “thank you.”
(man) What do you mean the donor?
(woman) You didn't know? An anonymous donor is paying the bill for most of the sculpture.
(man) Not the university?
(woman) No! His assumptions about who's paying are all wrong!
(man) Still, I wonder if he has a point about the space it'll take up?
(woman) Well, you know why Paul is upset. He and his friends are always out there on the lawn right where the sculpture will be, kicking around the soccer ball. Now they'll just have to use another part of the campus to play.
(man) Oh! So he just doesn't want to have to move.
(woman) Yeah! For him, it's sculpture versus convenience.
