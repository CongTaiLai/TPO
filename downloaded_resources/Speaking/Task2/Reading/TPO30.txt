I've noticed that small construction projects on campus – like fixing side walks and parking lots – often take place during the regular school year, when classes are in session.I propose that whenever possible the university should schedule such construction projects to take place during the three-month summer break. One reason is that construction projects can be so disruptive; they create inconveniences and can make it hard to get where you need to go on campus. And, second, construction projects would be more likely to be completed quickly if they were scheduled for the summer when the weather is usually good.Sincerely,Eric Hughes
