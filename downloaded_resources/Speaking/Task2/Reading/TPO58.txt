In addition to selling books and textbooks, I think the campus bookstore should also offer drinks and snacks for sale. The bookstore could have a few chairs and tables available where students could sit and have a snack or something to drink, while theyâ€™re looking through books and deciding what to buy. It would also be convenient for students who got hungry between classes, and wanted to grab something to eat before going to their next class.
