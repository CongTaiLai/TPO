I think the university should open a snack shop on campusâ€”a snack shop that would be operated entirely by our students. A student-run snack shop would benefit students in two ways. First, it would create a number of job opportunities for students. Second, the store would be a convenient place on campus to buy food, providing students with a fast, easy place to get snacks at any time of the day.
Sincerely, Julia Wilson
