State University will now require all students to complete ten hours of volunteer work in the local community before graduating. Serving as a volunteer is not only helpful to communities, but also beneficial and convenient for students. When they take time to help others, students experience a deep sense of satisfaction. This sense of fulfillment leads them to continue working within their communities. Furthermore, volunteering will be convenient for students. There are a number of nearby organizations in need of student volunteers, so students can easily arrange to work locally.
