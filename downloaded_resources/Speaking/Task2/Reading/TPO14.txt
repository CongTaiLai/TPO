Currently, there is a university-wide policy that prohibits eating in the classroom. I disagree with this policy. I think students should be allowed to eat in class. This change would be good for two reasons. For one thing, if students were permitted to eat, they would be able to concentrate better, because students often get hungry during long classes, and hunger makes it difficult to concentrate. Also, if food were allowed in classroom, it would be possible for us to have in-class parties on the last day of class – with snack foods and beverages – to celebrate the end of each semester.
Sincerely,
