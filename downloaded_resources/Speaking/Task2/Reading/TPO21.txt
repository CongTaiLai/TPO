The university will now send all students a daily e-mail containing information about campus events and activities. Rather than getting information about activities once a week in the campus newspaper, students will get the information every day, thus ensuring that it is always up-to-date. According to the university spokesperson who announced the plan, “For all of us now, e-mail is part of our daily lives. Students in particular have become used to relying on e-mail and the Internet for most communication, so this is a logical change that will benefit everyone.”
