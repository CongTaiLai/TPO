The university has decided to discontinue its free bus service for students. The reason given for this decision is that few students ride the buses and the buses arc expensive to operate. Currently, the buses run from the center of campus past university buildings and through some of the neighborhoods surrounding the campus. The money saved by eliminating the bus service will be used to expand the overcrowded student parking lots.
