Currently, the university choir gives singing concerts only on campus. Next year, however, the choir will add competitive events at other locations to its schedule. The choir’s new director feels that entering singing competitions will make the quality of the choir’s performance even better than it is now. “Competitions will motivate students in the choir to pursue a higher standard of excellence in singing,” he said. In addition, it is hoped that getting the choir off campus and out in the public will strengthen the reputation of the university’s music program. This in turn will help the program grow.
