No Sports on the Dining Hall Lawn

The open grassy area in front of the dining hall is one of the nicest features of our campus. Unfortunately, though, the grass is regularly trampled on and damaged by students playing games like soccer and Frisbee, resulting in ugly bare patches of dirt. I think the university should prohibit students from playing sports on the dining-hall lawn, so that the grass will look nicer.Banning sports from the lawn shouldnâ€™t inconvenience anyone, since there are fields next to the gym where students can play sports instead.

Sincerely,

Justin Ruben
