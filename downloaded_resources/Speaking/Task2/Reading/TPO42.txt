The administration has announced that starting next fall, the university will stop offering evening classes in many departments. According to a university administrator, the decision was prompted by a steady decline in enrollments in evening classes. "Evening classes are just too small," the administrator said. When asked to explain the decline in enrollments, the administrator pointed to the fact that most evening classes are taught by teaching assistants, who are usually graduate students. “Surveys show that students prefer to take classes taught by experienced faculty members,” the spokesperson said, "probably because they simply know more than graduate teaching assistants do."
