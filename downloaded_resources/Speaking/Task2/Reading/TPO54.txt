A university education should encourage students to engage with the world around them, but I see less and less of that engagement on campus today. I propose, therefore, that the university make community service, such as working with the local children in town, a mandatory activity for all university students before they graduate. Creating a community service requirement is a good idea because it would strengthen the relationship between our school and the town. Additionally, in fulfilling the requirement, many students would discover a love of service that would inspire them to a lifetime of volunteer work in their future communities.
Sincerely,
Sarah Brown
