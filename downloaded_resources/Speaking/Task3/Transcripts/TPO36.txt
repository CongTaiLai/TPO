Listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a theatre studies class.
So for example, back when I was in college, one of my roommates, Richard, was in a play I went to see. And when he first went on stage, I have to admit I was a little distracted. Richard was dressed up like an old man. I could tell that his hair was colored grey and he was pretending, you know, to be older. So he walked more slowly, the way in older person would. But at first, I only saw him as my roommate dressed up to look like an older man. But then as the play went on, I began to think of him less as the guy I live with, and more as this older man who was a father, one who had to work very hard for his family, the family in the play. And in the play, the father gets sick and so he's out of work. Would you know, caused me to become a little sad. And because of the father's lung illness, the family was worried that they wouldn't have enough money to pay the bills. And this made me feel worried too. Well, in the end, what happened was, the family all came together and everyone found job and started working. They all pinch in and help in the time of crisis. So the family gets by and pays the bills. And soon after the father recovered from his illness, And this made me feel relieved. And even rather happy.
