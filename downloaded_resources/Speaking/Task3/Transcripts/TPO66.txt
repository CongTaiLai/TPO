Okay. So here’s an example from my own life. 
A few years ago, I had the idea that I wanted to run in this race, this 10-kilometer race, which would be pretty far for me. So I needed to train for it ahead of time, to get in better physical shape so I would be ready to run that far because at the time I wasn’t really exercising much.
Well, I knew that the only time I had to train was in the mornings, before work, so I would need to get up early and run if I was going to be ready for that race. So the first few days I intended to get up early but when my alarm went off I didn’t feel like getting up and running, and I just roll over and go back to sleep. It definitely seemed like a better idea to sleep longer instead of going running.
So what I ended up doing was, I had this friend who I knew was also interested in doing some running, and I asked him if he would agree to meet me at a certain time each morning to go for a run together. I knew if I made a promise to meet my friend, I would be responsible and get up in the morning.
I wouldn’t just choose to go back to sleep. And it worked. I did get up and go each morning with my friend. I was able to improve my fitness enough that I eventually ran in the 10-kilometer race and did pretty well.
