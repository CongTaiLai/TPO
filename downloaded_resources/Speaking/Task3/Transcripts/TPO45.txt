Now listen to part of a lecture on this topic.
So how would this work?
Well, let's say you need to learn the names of the planets, in order, by distance from the Sun. So, first, think about the landmarks you pass as you walk from, say, your dormitory, to the student center. The first one might be the front door of your dormitory, then the big tree in front of the dorm. The next landmark you pass might be the statue in front of the library- Next, the steps to the science building. You get the idea.
You memorize the major points along the walk, imagining yourself going from the first landmark to the second, the third, and so on. Now, the next thing you do is assign one planet to each of your landmarks in sequence.
Since Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, you assign it to the first landmark, the front door of your dorm. The next planet, Venus, to the tree in front of the dorm. The third planet. Earth, you assign to the third landmark, the statue in front of the library, and so on and so on. And each time you picture the association in your mind as vividly as possible.
Then later, say you are sitting in the classroom taking a test, and you have to write the order of the planets from the Sun. What do you do? You imagine yourself on that familiar walk to the student center, passing each landmark as usual. When you think about walking out of the door of your dorm, you are reminded of Mercury. When you see the beautiful tree in front of the dorm, you'd think of Venus. At each landmark along the way, you recall the next planet and write it down.
