Now listen to part of a lecture on the topic in a Psychology class.
(Male) This happens all the time with kids in schools. Say there was a little boy or girl who's just starting school. Well, they're not really used to the rules about proper behaviors for classroom. So at the beginning they might, I don't know, interrupt the teacher, walk around the classroom when they're supposed to be sitting down. You know, just mis-behaving in general.Ok, but, what happens? Well, the teacher gets angry with them when they act this way. They might get punished. They have to sit at their desks when everyone else is allowed to go outside and play. And they certainly don't like that. Soon, they'll learn that this kind of behavior gets them in trouble. They'll also learn that when they raise their hand to talk to the teacher and sit quietly and pay attention during class, they are rewarded.The teacher tells them she's proud of them and maybe puts a little happy-face sticker ontheir homework. Now that their behavior gets a good reaction from the teacher, the kids learn to always act this way in class. And not behave the way they used to."
