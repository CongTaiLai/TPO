Okay. So there’s a good example of this. Recently a team of researchers was observing a certain type of squirrel, Eastern Grey Squirrels, gathering nuts for the winter. And of course, grey squirrels try to gather enough nuts so that they’ll have food to eat all winter long. And they dig holes in the ground and bury the acorns there.
But here’s what’s interesting: the grey squirrels don’t always put nuts in all of the holes they dig. If there’s another animal nearby that might want to eat the nuts, say, a bird, like a blue jay, the squirrel might dig a whole bunch of holes, but instead of putting nuts in all of them, the squirrel would just drop a twig or a stone in most of the holes, and only put nuts in a few.
But even though there aren’t any nuts in some of the holes, the squirrel will still go through the same process of covering these holes up with leaves and dirt as though they actually had nuts in them. So then a blue jay might find these holes and start digging in them. But since most of the holes only have a twig or a stone inside, the blue jay wouldn’t find a lot of nuts. So after a while, it’d lose interest and give up looking.
