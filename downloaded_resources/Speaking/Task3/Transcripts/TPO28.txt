Now listen to part of a lecture in a business class.
(male professor): Allright, so I actually saw a good example of this just the other day: I watched an advertisement on television about a well known companies pots and pans, and in the advertisement there was a woman, a professional cook, talking about how she uses the companies pots and pans in her own kitchen. Now the woman in the advertisement began by saying that this company's pots and pans were expensive. She just came right out and admitted to the audience that they cost a lot more than most other companies pots and pans. And she also said that she realized that when people went shopping for new cookware, they might feel that they just didn't want to spend all that money on such expensive pots and pans since there were so many in the store that cost a lot less.But then, she went on to explain that the extra cost was worthwhile, because, although these pots and pans cost more to begin with, they actually saved you money in the long run. How? Well, they came with a special lifetime warranty, which meant that the company would replace them free if anything ever went wrong, and thatâ€™s something most companies that make pots and pans couldn't say about their products.
