Now listen to part of a lecture in an education class.
(male professor) So I used to teach a class of eight year olds, and one problem I sometimes had was getting the kids to raise their hands when they wanted to answer a question. Like lots of teachers, I had the rule that if a student wanted to answer a question, they needed to raise their hands in the air and wait till I call their name before speaking. That gave all the students a chance to participate which helped everyone get more out of the discussion.But some kids had trouble following the rule. I remember there was one girl, Sara, who didn't raise her hand when she wanted to answer a question. She would just called out the answer. And this was frustrating for the other children who were waiting patiently with their hands raised. So one day when Sara called out, I asked her if she knew calling out was unfair to the other students.I said to her, “Sara, do you realize that when you call out answers, without raising your hand, you’re not being fair to the other students? You’re not giving them a chance to answer questions, too.” And I didn't wait for her to answer. I just continued teaching the class. And after that, anytime I asked the class a question, Sara didn't call out the answer. She raised her hand along with everyone else.
