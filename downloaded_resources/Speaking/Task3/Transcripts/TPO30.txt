Now, listen to part of a lecture in a Psychology class.
Professor (man): So, here's an example: my daughter had a friend over to our house recently and they decided to watch a movie together, only they got into an argument because they couldn't decide on what movie to watch. My daughter started to get quite upset during the argument, which wasn't like her at all. But then, my daughter stopped, and thought about why she was so upset. She realized her reaction was inappropriate, and she also realized she wasn't really upset with her friend…there was something else bothering her.See, she'd just gotten this summer job as a camp counselor for children, and she was feeling a lot of worry and stress about how well she would do, she said she'd never worked with children before, so she figured out that she wasn't upset about what movie to watch with her friend, but about starting her new job. She really wanted it to go well. She wanted the kids to like her. And when she understood this, she stopped arguing with her friend, and apologized to her. She told her friend how anxious she felt about starting the job, and how sorry she was about getting upset with her, and her friend encouraged her, saying she’d do great at the job! So my daughter felt better, and they relaxed and had fun together, same as always." "
