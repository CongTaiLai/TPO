Now listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class.
(male professor) OK, so an example to illustrate this, uh, you've often see this happen in families, let's say, there're these two kids, a sister and the brother. Uh, let's say the girl is six and the boy's four, and one day they're all out shopping with their mother, and they're in the store, and the girl sees a toy she wants. She asks her mother to buy, uh, to buy the toy for her but the mother says “no.” So, what does the little girl do? She starts crying and screaming and, you know, “Mommy, I want this!” And, finally, Mom gives in and says, “OK, fine, you can have it,” and buys the girl the toy.Now, don't forget, the little brother's there and he's watching all this happen, and maybe he sees these sorts of thing happen a lot, as mother giving in when his sister cries and screams. What do you think he's going to start doing when he wants something from Mom? He'll probably cry and scream, right?But, what if the opposite happened? Say Mom didn't give in and didn't buy the girl the toy, if fact, say, the Mom instead disciplined the girl for screaming and crying when they got home she didn’t let the little girl watch her favorite TV program. Again, the little boy is watching. Now, what’s the little boy likely to do if he finds himself in a similar situation and he wants Mom to buy him something? Chances are, he’s not gonna cry and scream. Right?
