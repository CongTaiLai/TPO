When a student engages in disruptive behavior in the classroom, it negatively impacts both the teacher’s ability to teach and other students’ ability to learn. One way a teacher can correct distrptive behavior is by questioning awareness of effect. With this technique, when a student disrupts the class, the teacher asks the student a question that draws attention to the negative effect of the student’s behavior. The teacher then does not wait for an answer, but immediately continues teaching. By thus simply drawing attention to the effect of the student’s behavior, the teacher can often lead the student to discontinue the behavior.
