One objective of any experiment is, of course, to obtain accurate results.Sometimes, however, problems occur that lead to in accurate results. One such problem is the experimenter effect. The experimenter effect occurs when searcher â€™s expectations affect the outcome of the experiment. The researcher expects a particular result from the experiment, and that expectation causes the researcher to act in ways that influence the behavior of the experiment participants, thereby invalidating the results of the experiment.
