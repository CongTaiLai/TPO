Goal DisplacementOrganizations often have a particular goal, and specific rules or procedures may be created to help achieve that goal. However, sometimes employees focus so much on the rules or procedures that it interferes with the organization's ability to achieve its goal. This is known as goal displacement. A goal becomes displaced when the rules or procedures meant to help individuals achieve a goal become more important than the goal itself. As a result, the organization may be less successful in accomplishing its goals.
