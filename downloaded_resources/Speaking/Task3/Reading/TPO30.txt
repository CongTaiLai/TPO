We often think of human intelligence as the mental ability to analyze and understand complex ideas. However, many psychologists believe that there is a different type of intelligence called emotional intelligence. People with emotional intelligence have the ability to recognize their true feelings and understand what is causing them. This ability to understand their own feelings enables them to better control their emotional responses, changing or correcting them when necessary. Emotional intelligence helps people to behave appropriately in social situations, which allow them to maintain good relationships with others.
