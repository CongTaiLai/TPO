One way people learn is by watching the behavior of others. Sometimes called social learning, this type of learning involves the process of learning to copy – or not copy – the action of another. By observing the results, or consequences, of another’s behavior, people learn, over time, to either imitate or avoid imitating that behavior. In general, people tend to imitate the behavior of another when they see that it leads to a desirable consequence – hoping to repeat it for themselves. Of course, the opposite is also true – people tend to avoid imitating the behavior of another when they see it result in an undesirable consequence.
