People deal with each other every day. This interaction is at the heart of social life. The study of social interaction is concerned with the influence people have over one another s behavior. People take each other into account in their daily behavior and in fact, the very presence of others can affect behavior. For example, one principle of social interaction, audience effects, suggests that individualsâ€™ work is affected by their knowledge that they are visible to others, that the presence of others tends to alter the way people behave or perform an activity.
