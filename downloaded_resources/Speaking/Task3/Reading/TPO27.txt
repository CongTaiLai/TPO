Some insect species live in large groups, or “swarms.” Such swarms typically include several thousand individual insects. Living in swarms allows these insects to accomplish complex tasks together through complex behaviors. The behavior of the insects as a group demonstrates a greater level of complexity than the behavior of individual group members. This complex group behavior is called swarm intelligence. With swam intelligence, each insect performs a simple instinctual behavior that is repeated by other individuals that results in a complex behavior. Insect swarms are able to accomplish tasks that individual insects would not be able to achieve.
