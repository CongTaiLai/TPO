Near-Field Sound DetectionSome animals are able to use sound to avoid predators. When sound is produced, it creates vibrations in the surrounding air. These vibrations are known as near-field sounds because they originate, or begin, near the sound source. Most animals are unable to detect these kinds of sounds; however, some animals have an ability known as near-field sound detection. This ability allows certain animals to detect vibrations or near-field sounds produced by potential predators. Animals with near-field sound detection abilities have special physical features that allow them to sense an approaching predator and take action to protect themselves.
