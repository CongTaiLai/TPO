The truth is we don’t know what the main cause of 
extinction of Steller’s sea cow was. There are problems with each of the
 theories that you read about.First, the sea cows were massive 
creatures. They were up to nine meters long and could weigh over ten 
tons, just enormous. A couple of sea cows could feed a small Siberian 
village for months. And the population of the native Siberian people 
wasn’t very large. So while the Siberians certainly did hunt the sea 
cows, they didn’t need to hunt a lot of them. So it’s unlikely they were
 the ones who brought the sea cows to the point of extinction.Second, 
about a hypothetical decrease in kelp caused by ecological disturbances,
 well, if something severe really happened in the ecosystem near Bering 
Island sometime before 1768, it would have affected not just the kelp 
but also other parts of the ecosystem. For example, it would have caused
 the decline in other marine animals like whales. But fishing ships in 
the area did not report a whale decline. Since there is no indication of
 broader ecosystem problems, the kelp was probably growing just fine and
 the sea cows did not experience food shortage.Third, it might seem like
 the European traders were responsible because the sea cows became 
extinct soon after the Europeans arrived. But, actually, by the time 
that the Europeans arrived, the sea cow population was already quite 
small. We have evidence that the sea cow population was at its largest 
hundreds of years before the 1700s. So something was causing a serious 
and on-going decrease in the sea cow population long before the 
Europeans arrived in the Bering Island area. Whatever this something 
was, it should be considered the main cause of the extinction, not the 
European traders who were just the last to arrive.
