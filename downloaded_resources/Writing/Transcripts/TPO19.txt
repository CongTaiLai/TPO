Hi, my name is Bill. Um, I was talking your professor in the subway about the great phone service that I was using. And it turned out we're both interested in marketing. So he asked me to talk in his marketing classes. You see, I am a buzzer, part time, you know. During the day, I'm a student just like you. Now, I read that piece attacking buzzing, it is really misleading. How would it describe buzzing leading a lot, and gives a wrong impression?First, it makes it sound like buzzers don't tell the truth about the products they're buzzing. That's not true. How buzzing works this. Companies find people who use their products and who really think product is good. So buzzing is not like ordinary advertisement where an actress is paid to read some lies. Um, yes, I get paid for telling you what I am thinking, but you get the truth from buzzers. I really do think my phone service is great. That is why the company hired me.Second, the reading makes it seem that when a buzzer talks to someone, the person believes whatever they hear from the buzzer. Not true. In fact, the opposite is true. People talk to ask a lot of questions about the products I buzz, that is about the price, service and how long I used the product. If I don't have good answers, they won't buy the products.Finally, if you believe what you read, buzzing will destroy civilization, that is stupid. If a product is bad, the company can't recruit buzzers. So what you get from a buzzer is not only sincere but is likely to be about a good product. If you try the phone service I use, you're gonna love it. So people who try buzzed products are going to have a good experience. So end up being more trustful and open up to people.
