The reasons against using the box-like devices to grow trees are not very convincing. It is worthwhile to use these devices to help grow trees in the fight against desertification.First, the cost. You have to take into account that once a young tree growing inside the device gets bigger, the device can be removed and used to start growing a new tree. In other words, the devices can be reused—each can be used twenty times or more. If you divide the cost of one device by the number of trees you can use it for, the cost becomes much more reasonable.Second, about installing and maintaining the devices. It’s true that people are being asked to maintain trees that they cannot use for food. But still, there are possible rewards for the local people who help with this project. For one thing, the devices can be used to collect water for other plants, not just trees. If the locals are allowed to use some of the devices for their vegetables, for example, that should help them grow more food.Another benefit to the locals is that once the trees become larger, the trees’ branches can be used for firewood. Having access to more food and more firewood should provide motivation for the local people to take part in the project.Third, a tree can survive very harsh conditions once it outgrows the box-like device. That’s because the devices help young trees grow long roots. Those long roots are able to reach down to the moist soil that lies beneath the dry desert surface. Once the tree roots reach the sources of water underground, the trees can survive without the devices. In a recent effort to grow trees in the Sahara Desert using the devices, ninety percent of the trees were still thriving two years after the devices had been removed.
