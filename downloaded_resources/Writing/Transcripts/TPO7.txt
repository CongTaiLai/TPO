Well, despite what many people say, there is a good reason to think that many American wood companies will eventually seek eco-certificaiton for the wood products.First off, companies in the United States don't treat all advertising the same. They distinguish between advertising claims that companies make about their own products and claims made by independent certification agencies. Americans have a lot of confidence in independent agencies. Thus ecologically-minded Americans are likely to react very favorably to wood products ecologically certified by independent organization with an international reputation for trustworthiness.Second point, of course it is true that American consumers care a lot about price, who doesn't? But studies of how consumers make decisions show that price alone determines consumers' decisions only when the price of one competing products much higher or lower than the other. When the difference between two products issmall, say, less than 5 percent, as is the case with certified wood, American often do choose on factories other than price. And Americans are becoming increasingly convinced of the value of preserving and protecting the environment.And third, US Wood companies should definitely pay attention what is going on in the wood business internationally. Not because of foreign consumers but because of foreign competitors. As I just told you, there is a good chance that many American consumers will be interested in eco-certified products, and guess why? If American companies are slow capturing those consumers, you can be sure foreign companies will soon start crowding into the American markets, offering eco-certified wood that domestic companies don't.
